# misc
Miscellaneous data for various projects. The only interesting thing is maybe this one:

  EasyWordCloud.ipynb: a small interactive utility (built on top of Mueller's WordCloud for Python library) which allows to build wordclouds from custom texts and images. Reference Medium   article: *The Aesthetics of Wordclouds* (https://towardsdatascience.com/the-aesthetic-of-wordclouds-a616208420f1).

Ignore the rest.
